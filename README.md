## Overview

Flashback is a lightweight game clip capture and editor for Windows, built with Tauri v2 and Rust. It stays extremely light and fast and does one thing well — capture and edit clips, nothing else. No social feed, no achievements, no accounts, no forced cloud.

The goal is an app you can open, start, and forget is even running.

## Architecture

```
src/                   SvelteKit frontend (config, library, editor)
└── routes/            UI views
static/                Static assets
src-tauri/
├── src/lib.rs         Tauri commands + app logic
├── src/main.rs        Entry point
├── icons/             App icons
└── tauri.conf.json    Window + bundle config
```

The Rust backend does the heavy lifting — capture, the instant-replay buffer, hardware encoding, the local library and editing. The SvelteKit frontend is only for configuration and editing; it sends intents to the backend over Tauri's `invoke` and reflects state.
